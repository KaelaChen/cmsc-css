# cmsc css

These are themes for the [CMSC 341](https://userpages.umbc.edu/~cmarron/cs341.f19/) website. They are responsive, allowing for split-screen while you code.
 
## How to Use

### Firefox

1. Download the theme(s) you want.
2. Open the Style Editor (Shortcut: Shift + F7)

Once the Style Editor is open, you should see a '+' on the left side of the panel. Next to it is a little box with an arrow. Click that button and load the theme you want to use.

### Google Chrome

This one is unfortunately a bit more work.

1. Open Chrome Developer Tools (Shortcut: F12)
2. Click the '+' on the right side to generate a new style sheet
3. Click on the new link ('inspector-stylesheet')
4. Paste the theme's text into it.

## Modifying
