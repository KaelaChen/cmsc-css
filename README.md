These are themes for the [CMSC 341](https://userpages.umbc.edu/~cmarron/cs341.f19/) website. They are responsive, allowing for split-screen while you code.
 
## How to Use

You can apply a theme to your current page by using the Style Editor in your browser's Developer Tools.

### Google Chrome

### Firefox

Keyboard Shortcut: Shift + F7

Or, go to Tools > Web Developer > Style Editor

Once the Style Editor is open, you should see a '+' on the left side of the panel. Next to it is a little box with an arrow. Click that button and load the theme you want to use.
